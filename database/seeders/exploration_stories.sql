You run as fast as you can to catch up to it. When you get close you see that it has a number of small stone legs around the outside, all of them carrying it forward.

Good luck!" and nothing else standing next to an opening in the hedge. When you walk into the opening you find it is like a small hallway with a sharp right turn at the end.

	(36, 'flying-squirrel-airport', 1, 'Flying Squirrel Airport', 'It looks like an airport. There is a control tower and a runway and some small hangars. You don\'t however see or hear any planes. Well, maybe it\'s just a not-very-busy airport. You sit down to watch. Suddenly a bat leans out of the control tower and shouts through a magical megaphone, "You are cleared to land on runway 1." You look and a flying squirrel wearing fancy pilot goggles and a long silk scarf comes floating in for a gentle landing.', ''),
	(37, 'magic-growing-farms', 1, 'Magic-growing Farms', 'It seems to be an ordinary farm but all the farmers are wearing long robes with strange symbols.

Three massive plains tortoises are crawling slowly around the track. Each has a number painted on its side. The move very slowly. The young woman next to you nudges you. "Number 3 is just a neck ahead! Isn’t this exciting?"', ''),
	(41, 'fallen-star-lake', 1, 'Fallen Star Lake', 'It\'s a lake but it seems almost out of place. Everywhere around you the land has soft edges and smooth curves. The boundaries of this lake, however, are sharp, as if someone scooped it out of the grasslands. At the bottom of the lake is a faint but beautiful glow. A sign claims that this is Fallen Star Lake, created long ago by a falling star. The water feels warm. The glint of the star under the water must be what gives this place its magical warmth and light. ', ''),
	(42, 'pipe-ceremony', 1, 'Pipe Ceremony', 'A group of plains Fae sits around a campfire. The sun is setting in the distance and a gentle breeze blows across this gathering. It seems very peaceful and almost spiritual in its serenity. A few of Fae are humming but none of them says anything. A single pipe is being passed around the circle.

Some of the walls are carved with images that time has faded and with words in a language time has forgotten. From the top here you can see a vast distance across the Grasslands.

The voices continue on in this vein, each interrupting the next talking about all kinds of complicated sounding things. You don\'t see anyone doing the talking however.

A large, juicy, sun-warmed watermelon is split open in front of them and each has broken off a large piece. They rock slowly in the sun, taking turns spitting seeds at a tiny target.

	(48, 'greased-pig-wrestling', 1, 'Greased Pig Wrestling', 'Greased pig wrestling! You\'ve heard of it, but rarely seen it. A group of Halflings are gathered together in front of their tiny homes, singing and laughing. They appear to have been enjoy a bit of the homebrew they are so well known for.

You see a giant man whose massive upper body is covered with dark hair and whose head is that of a bull. He has huge hooves instead of feet. He\'s easily twice as tall as most humans you know. He introduces himself as a cloudwalker.', ''),

The massive creatures are leaping around in the water chasing a ball the size of a small boat. Their scaly green hides reflect the sun.

Beyond that, however, it is a lot less familiar. It has strange towers and odd rooms with lots of windows all over it. Every little bit is covered in intricate carvings and complicated paintings. The multi-colored sails all seem to be blowing in different directions. And the crew, well, they\'re the second strangest part about this remarkable ship. They are sea elves, with their long ears tattooed indicating their clan, their wild colorful garments and their musical voices. The strangest thing about the whole vision is that the ship doesn\'t touch the water. It floats above with only the slightest ripple showing where it passed.', ''),

It slowly raises its massive head from the water and studies you with one ice-blue eye for a very long time. It seems to look into your very soul. You study your reflection for a time.

Surrounded by just a few floating rocks is... a water island. Like a reverse bubble, the island of water is held together by the strange gravitational forces at work in Skyland. While some creatures and caretakers rest on the small rocks surrounding the water island, others are swimming inside of it. Because the water is so clear, you can see all of them swimming in there, and decide to join in.', ''),

Once you land on it, the "ground" gives way beneath you and your stomach plummets as you fall.  It\'s not a long drop, thankfully, and you find yourself in a mess of action.  There are huge screens everywhere, images flickering across them too fast for you to see, and concerned creatures bent over the consoles.  A Nautus studies you, a cap on his head; around his neck, he wears a collar pinned with medals.   "Captain Hart," he tells you.  "Sorry, the sub\'s cloaking is malfunctioning.  Welcome to Skyland Monitoring Station Four."', ''),

Well, that\'s to say, there\'s a ride – huge teacups that swirl around – and a tea house serving delicious tea in normal cups. You also notice that the ride\'s big cups are all replicas of the smaller drinking cups. Or maybe it\'s the other way around. Either way, it\'s a nice touch. Two Blossoms are running the place: the younger, more adventurous one is in charge of the ride and the older, calmer one is preparing the tea. You wonder which to try first.', ''),

Your jaw drops as you watch them - this might be the most mesmerizing thing you\'ve seen in the park yet. When the show is over, the Dualis stay to talk to people and hand out autographs.
